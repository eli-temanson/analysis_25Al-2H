# Error Quantification

## $\sigma$ -- Cross section 
The cross section has a systematic and statistical error of 0.78 and 0.09 mb, respectively. I need to use the two errors to determine the uncertainty of the $C^{2}S_{\ell = 0}$, i.e. the min. and max crossing point for our fresco model.

 - The systematic error of the cross section comes from a 10% error in the $^{2}H$ in the target, and a 9% error of the detection efficency. 
 - The statistical error uses the yield and the down-scaled ion chamber monitor.
 - As you stated we are dominated by the 13% error of the systematic uncertainty. 

## $C^{2}S_{\ell=0}$
The uncertainty from our spectroscopic factor matching to the cross section is ~15% but I had overestimated it when I reported it as 25% to include systematic uncertainty of our FRESCO model i.e. optical model parameters. 

 - $\Delta C^{2}S^{stat.}_{\ell=0} / C^{2}S_{\ell=0}$ = 13.4%
 - $\Delta C^{2}S^{sys.}_{\ell=0} / C^{2}S_{\ell=0}$ = 1.6%
 - 20% might be more appropriate? (I will continue with 15% for now) 

## $\Gamma_{p}$

 - Single particle proton width, $\Gamma^{s.p.}_{p}$, 5% systematic error from the FRESCO CRC model and normalization of the wave function. I overestimated the error perviously having an 18% uncertainty.

## $\Gamma_{\gamma}$
***I had an error in my error propagation. now $\Delta\omega\gamma / \omega\gamma$ = 47% (dominated by $\Gamma\gamma$)***
