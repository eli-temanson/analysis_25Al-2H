# Error Quantification of $\Gamma_p$

The cross section has a systematic and statistical error of 0.78 and 0.09 mb, respectively. I need to use the two errors to determine the uncertainty of the $C^{2}S_{\ell = 0}$, i.e. the min. and max crossing point for our fresco model.

**What about the error of the optical model parameters and the CRC calculations?**

I need to calculated the stat. and sys. error of the single particle width which will come from the stat. and sys. error of the resonance energy.
